<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>Coming to software development in the late-2000s from a systems and network administrator background, I carried over a lot of the troubleshooting, investigative, pragmatic mindset one needs to survive in that line of work. :)</p>

<p>Before that, I started as systems and network administrator and coder in the early 2000s, coming from being an architect’s son and apprentice. Taught, then, at early age, to be on the lookout for what belongs to the parts, their roles, the big picture, and what belongs to the whole (the “more than the sum of its parts” thing) and to get a <em>feel</em> for a system’s behaviour.</p>

<h3 id="the-software-development-craft">The software development craft</h3>

<p>Most people approach their craft as generalists (wide focus, and shallow skillset) or specialists (narrow focus with deep skillset). That usually works well and there’s nothing wrong with that. For myself, I seek being both wide and deep in the craft of web software development. I seek the end-to-end, cradle-to-grave, understanding and delivery. That’s easier said than done, obviously, and as a professional I’ve been wearing many hats over the years, often playing the role of a specialist, but always seeking, with a generalist’s heart, the bigger picture.</p>

<p>And if you’re paying attention, you’ll notice some things (or, rather, some conceptual structures) just pop over, and over, again. The more we practice our craft, the more we learn, the more capable we become of recognizing these patterns and structures for what they are, communicating about them, and of translating solutions across domains or abstraction levels.</p>

<p>It’s a bit like what happens with learning musical instruments: I went from the classical guitar to the electric, then folk, 12-string, then bass and banjo. Most of my skills just ported from one instrument to the other, but each new instrument gave me a broader, richer, grasp of a bigger picture in music.</p>

<h3 id="the-cat-what-the-hack">The Cat? What the Hack?</h3>

<ul class="bullet">
  <li>A tip of the hat to <code>find</code>, <code>cat</code>, <code>grep</code> and those that have accompanied me all my computer science life</li>
  <li>I work from home, and whenever I’m hacking, my two cats are probably sleeping around me</li>
  <li>The Dr Seuss reference talks to the fun and whimsical side of hacking things together</li>
  <li>There’s a lightheartedness to it that sets the tone just right!</li>
</ul>
